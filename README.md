## Targeted audience  :family: 
This repo is for those who wanted to kickstart android development or just started and looking for a reference app that will teach them a few advanced concepts.

## Goal  :dart:
The goal of the DevFest 2020 mobile track is to teach you Android development covering basics, intermediate, and advanced topics by creating a BookMyShow movie listing clone. The mobile track is divided into 3 levels
1. Beginner - Covering Android UI basics.
2. Intermediate - Covering [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make an API request to remote server and [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview).
3. Expert - Covering MVVM architecture and [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) Database for offline support.

In the end, you will get an app with a nice movie listing UI supporting offline access.


## How to use this repo to follow sessions? :technologist:

Repo has 3 branches beginner, intermediate, and expert. 
[Day 1](https://youtu.be/C8k9mdb9NE8?t=4374) starts with creating a fresh project and the beginner branch is a snapshot of that. The intermediate branch is a snapshot of the end of day 1. [Day 2](https://youtu.be/chtdrBvJpZ4?t=3830) starts from the intermediate branch and leads you to the expert branch. Finally, [day 3](https://youtu.be/WrSvFgvEyKY?t=5462) starts with the expert branch and leads you to the master branch.

So if you know the basics of android development and join us directly on day 2 checkout the intermediate branch and follow along. Similarly, if you are joining us directly on the day 3 checkout expert branch and follow along.

> Please note we are using [the movie DB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to get movies from the remote server.
To get movies from API you would need an API key. 
>
> Try this in your code: 
>    ```kotlin
>    companion object {
>        private const val API_KEY = "7bc0651fe0ea5973822df3bd27e779d9"
>    }
>    ```
> We would recommend to generate your own API key and use it if above key is not working. Please follow the below steps to configure your own API key. 
>
>1. Register yourself on https://www.themoviedb.org/signup 
>2. Fill all the required details to signup. 
>3. Open your email and verify the email to get started. (Activate your account)
>4. Do login with the username and the password(you provided during signup)
>5. On Top right corner -> Click on your profile icon -> Settings -> API  -> Request an Api Key -> Choose developer option(for demo/sample project ) -> Accept the terms -> Fill all the required details (You can give dummy value for application url as you wonâ€™t be having that, give good summary for application summary) -> Submit -> Copy API key and use.
>
>Also, note that this will be required for Day 2 where we hit API using retrofit
